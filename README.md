## Motivation

The motivation for this project is to provide users with a convenient and efficient way to record tasks/notes for later refernce. Being provided the front-end code for this project, my main objective is to write the backend and create a connection between the front and backend.

In completing this project, I have learned the basic concepts of Express.js. I have also learned the benefits of utilizing modular routes to maintain cleaner code.
